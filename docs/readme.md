# Kielipankki-konversio/docs

This folder contains the pipeline instructions for preparing text corpora. 
Described are all steps needed from converting the original data to publishing the corpus in Korp.


The instructions are accessible through the browser interface:
https://github.com/CSCfi/Kielipankki-konversio/

or on Taito in the Git repository 'Kielipankki-konversio'.
Here you should update your own copy of the repository with 'git pull' to see the latest changes.

A third option would be to use the desktop client of GitHub.

The instructions are organized in several files, all stored in this subfolder 'docs'.
The main file of the instructions is 'howto-pipeline-textcorpora-020919.md'. From here the other files are referred to.

The instructions are written in Markdown format. (For more information please see: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
The browser interface of GitHub displays this nicely and makes it easy to read and edit the text.

Please feel free to give feedback, correct and edit the instructions where needed, and add what you think is missing.
You can also add new files and refer to them from the main file. You might find placeholders in the text for still missing information (e.g. a guideline for testing text corpora in Korp) and of course everybody is welcome to fill them.
