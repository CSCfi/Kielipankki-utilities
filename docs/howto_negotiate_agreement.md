# Negotiating the deposition agreement for an individual resource

(instructions in progress)

In order to begin preparing and negotiating the agreement, you will need at least the official title (Finnish+English) and PID (resolving to a public metadata record) of the resource in question. 
The PID is important for the agreement since we need to be specific and unambiguous about what data is going to end up in the Language Bank.

## Collect the required information with the help of the depositor

  * Rightholder / Oikeudenhaltija
    * name of the contact person for the Rightholder
  * Data Controller / Rekisterinpitäjä (in case the resource contains personal data)
    * name of the contact person for the Data Controller
  * a preliminary decision or suggestion regarding the license category of the resource (PUB/ACA/RES)

## Contact legal support at UHEL, if required

  * obtain preliminary approval of unclear cases

## Prepare a draft of the agreement

  * create a subfolder for the agreement under the [OneDrive directory](https://helsinkifi-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/lennes_ad_helsinki_fi/Documents/Kielipankin%20sopimusasiat/DELA%20-%20Aineistokohtaisten%20sopimusten%20valmistelu?csf=1&web=1&e=9y4CLl)
