# Adding news to the Korp newsdesk
When a new or a user-visibly updated corpus has been configured in Korp and is ready to use, 
it is worthwhile to write a short piece of news that is shown in Korpâ€™s internal newsdesk, 
opened from the bell icon near the top right corner of the Korp page.

Instructions on how to create this news item can be found in [Kielipankki: Adding news to the Korp newsdesk](https://www.kielipankki.fi/development/korp/corpus-import/#Adding_news_to_the_Korp_newsdesk).
