# Transferring files from Puhti via Funet FileSender

To transfer files from Puhti via Funet FileSender (without downloading them first to your local computer), you can use the graphical desktop interface in your web browser.

Log in to Puhti at https://www.puhti.csc.fi/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood-vnc/default/session_contexts/new

In Apps, select Desktop. Request for a new desktop and start it as soon as it is initialized for you.

In the Linux desktop, open the web browser and go to filesender.funet.fi. Upload files from your Puhti directory and send them normally.
