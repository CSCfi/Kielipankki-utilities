# Transferring files from Puhti via Funet FileSender

To transfer files from Puhti via Funet FileSender (without downloading them first to your local computer), you can use the graphical desktop interface in your web browser.

Log in to Puhti at https://www.puhti.csc.fi/.

In Apps, select Desktop. Request for a new desktop (direct link: https://www.puhti.csc.fi/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ood-vnc/default/session_contexts/new) and start the desktop as soon as it is initialized for you.

In the Linux desktop, open the web browser and go to filesender.funet.fi. Upload files from your Puhti directory and send them normally.
