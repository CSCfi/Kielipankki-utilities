# How to clean data from Puhti after a package has been successfully published
After a corpus is successfully published, all related data should be removed from Puhti. Of course, before cleaning it should be made sure, that the source data has been backed up on the HFST server and the package has been published in Korp or the Download Service.

## Source and VRT corpora
Source and VRT versions of a corpus are published in the Download Service. After the corpus has been successfully published and the news written, the download package, MD5 checksum file, README and LICENSE files  should be removed from the directory {{/scratch/clarin/download_preview}} on Puhti.
Also related data used for creating the package and stored in some other place on Puhti (e.g. the personal scratch folder), should be removed at this point.

## Korp corpora
For Korp versions the cleaning of any conversion data from Puhti should be done after the beta status has been removed from the published corpus.

Usually the person who ran korp-make would also clean up the packages and other data generated by korp-make, that is /scratch/clarin/korp/corpora/pkgs/corpusid/* and /scratch/clarin/korp/corpora/vrt/corpusid/* where corpusid is the Korp corpus id for a (sub)corpus.

Korp versions should also be removed from the testing environment of Korp (Korp test version), after the beta status has been removed from the published corpus.
