# Create a news item in the portal
Whenever a new resource is published in either Korp or the download service, a news item should be created to 
spread the news. The news should always be published in both English and Finnish.

The portal pages are:

[https://www.kielipankki.fi/news/](https://www.kielipankki.fi/news/)

[https://www.kielipankki.fi/uutiset/](https://www.kielipankki.fi/uutiset/)

In order to create a news item, go to [Kielipankki.fi/wp-admin](https://www.kielipankki.fi/wp-admin/) (login with uni account, you need the VPN if working remotely).
In wp-admin on the left you can find 'Uutiset' for the news in Finnish and 'News' for the news in English.
Press 'add news'.

The news item should have a title, which includes the name of the resource. For introducing a new resource, the name of the resource together with links to its META-SHARE record,
location and resource group page should be given. No categories, icons etc. are needed.

Try to publish the news in both languages at about the same time. It is recommended to create them first as drafts and publish them later.
You can also define a date for publication.
