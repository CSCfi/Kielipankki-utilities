# Create a resource group page in the portal

Resource group pages are created for all our resources (corpora, lexical resources, tools and web services). A resource group page contains all the relevant information about the resource and offers an overview of the latest versions, may it be source, VRT or Korp. 

Tools are mostly accessible via a web interface, or they can be installed via download from e.g. GitHub or Korp. Some tools were developed by member organizations of FIN-CLARIN / CLARIN ERIC. A resource group page offers detailed information about the tool, its usage, links to developers' webpages, user instuctions or download location. 

A resource group page is linked to from [Kielipankki's resource families page](https://www.kielipankki.fi/corpora/resource-families-fin-clarin/). 

It should be tagged with categories (the particular Clarin resource family), to provide search possibilities in the portal. A resource can belong to more than one resource family. 

Each resource group page has to have a PID. For instructions on how to request a PID, see [docs: how to request a PID](howto_request_pid.md)

The resource group page is linked to from the respective META-SHARE record of the resource as well as from the [list of published corpora](https://www.kielipankki.fi/corpora/) in the portal (column 'help') with the help of its PID. (NOTE: Resources and tools not directly offered by Kielipankki, but by a member organization of FIN-CLARIN, might not have a META-SHARE record.)

In the [list of tools](https://www.kielipankki.fi/tools/) the link to the resource group page is added to the column 'Info'.

In order to create a resource group page in the portal, go to [Kielipankki.fi/wp-admin](https://www.kielipankki.fi/wp-admin/) (login with your university account, you need the VPN when working remotely).
It is possible to edit existing pages.
Open the editor for the English and the Finnish template pages on separate browser tabs and create a copy of each page as the starting points for the new resource group pages â€“ click on 'Kopioi uudeksi luonnokseksi':
[kielipankki.fi/intra/aineistosivumalli-eng/](https://www.kielipankki.fi/intra/aineistosivumalli-eng/) | 
[kielipankki.fi/intra/aineistosivumalli](https://www.kielipankki.fi/intra/aineistosivumalli/)
(Or, to start by creating a new blank page, press 'uusi sivu'.)
The first, bold text (document) will be the name of the page (link).
The following bold text will be the headline of the page.

The content of a resource group page is usually:

- The name of the resource (headline)
- A description of the resource containing all relevant details, sometimes also links to related sources outside of Kielipankki. Check the META-SHARE record and take all relevant information from there.
- A table of the latest versions/subcorpora of the resource. Each version/subcorpus is put to its own row in the table. Links to the particular META-SHARE record, citation information and access location are given.
- A link to all available versions of this resource in META-SHARE (search result list)
- A PID

In the WordPress page editor, in the window on the right, you should choose one or more of the given categories (resource families). 
If a category is missing, you can add it here.

A page created in Kielipankki can be put to 'privat' first. Then it is only visible to the author.

You can check the appearance of your page by pressing the 'preview' button.

Remember to choose the correct language of the page below. Then the other language options on the page are shown correctly.
Most of the resource group pages are written in English.

After everything is done, the page should be put to 'public' and be published.

The page can be moved in the 'tree view' in the menu on the left (e.g. to the folder 'corpora'). This can also be done after publishing the page.

The PID of the resource group page should then be added to the [resource families page](https://www.kielipankki.fi/corpora/resource-families-fin-clarin/ "resource families page"), to the resource's META-SHARE record and to the list of published resources or the list of tools respectively.
