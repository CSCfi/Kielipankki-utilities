# The codes are mostly MALT codes, used in Korp for constructing the
# word picture: SS (subject), OBJ (object), ADV (adverbial), PA
# (preposition), AT ((pre)modifier), ET (postmodifier). In addition,
# some MAMBA codes are used from
# http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/~nivre/swedish_treebank/dep.html
# Too many relations (most modifiers and complements) might be mapped
# to AT; some of them should perhaps be ET or XX.
