Not sure if konversio repo is the right place,
but the ./idals script needs some home to stay
safe. The script is also (currently) wired for
FIN-CLARIN data. (In a bit more ideal world it
would read the host and project from the user's
~/.ida-config but this world is not that world.)

Comment in script links to relevant IDA pages.
