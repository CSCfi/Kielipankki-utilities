A 20 paragraphs of raw lorem ipsum was generated by the service
https://fi.lipsum.com, copied, pasted, structured by hand, then
vrt-tokenize, then hand again. All data is copies or extracts.

Fields in this directory, data.n/, are named, hence the n.
The named data is the result of applying vrt-name to the
documents in a copy of the original unnamed hierarchy.

Important for testing packing is to have
- variety of length
- variety of directory depth
- some other than *.vrt documents
- a couple of documents that lack a newline at end.
