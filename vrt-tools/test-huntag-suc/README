The script ./test.sh that exercises ../vrt-huntag-suc is runnable in
Taito, assuming the underlying hunpos-tag and its model files are
still in the same locations and accessible by the user. The idea is
that they will be in some permanent location eventually.

The expected output is something like the following, where the
executable script is ../vrt-huntag-suc but the paths are expanded.

Test data (in ./text.vrt) was copied from Svenska YLE.

The subdirectories are re-created on every run.
