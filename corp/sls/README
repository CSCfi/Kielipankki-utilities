SLS data

Original data from "Spara talet metadata - transkriptioner export.xlsx".

The fields "Signum", "Objekt-titel", "Filnamn", "Rubrik" and "Titel" are found as attributes of the "text" 
field.

The attribute names are not the same as in the xlsx file:
Signum -> signum, Objekt-titel -> object, Filnamn -> filename, Rubrik -> headline, Titel -> title

The data in the "Ordförklaringar" field is in the "explanation" attribute of each corresponding paragraph.
These are matched by the explanation numbers in the text.

Some texts have normalized versions available in the original file. In these cases the normalized version
is used in the paragraph field and the original text can be found in the attribute "original".
In some cases the original texts are incorrectly in cell G and the normalizations are in cell F. This has not
been corrected.

Paragraphs where the normalizations and original text are not automatically lined up in the xlsx file do not
have the original text as an attribute. If the speakers in the original and the normalization are not lined 
up, the attribute "original" has the value "not match".


Samples of Edelfelt’s letters

(Converted by Jyrki Niemi)

The original data in slsa367_*.docx was first converted to plain text
(UTF-8) with the unoconv program using LibreOffice (in local Ubuntu).

The text files were then converted to VRT via HRT as follows (assuming
data in a temporary subdirectory “data” and “bin” symlinked to a clone
of Kielipankki-utilities GitHub repository):

  bin/corp/sls/edelfelt-txt-to-hrt data/slsa367_1867_*.txt |
  perl -ne '
      if (/-$/) {
          s/-\n$//;
          $prev = "$prev$_"
      } else {
          print "$prev$_";
          $prev = ""
      }' |
  bin/vrt-tools/hrt-encode-tags |
  bin/vrt-tools/hrt-tokenize-udpipe --model swedish-talbanken |
  bin/vrt-tools/vrt-decode-tags > data/edelfelt_sample.vrt

The Perl snippet joins hyphenated words across line breaks. We
probably should have a proper tool for that.

A Korp corpus package was then created with korp-make without any
configuration options.
