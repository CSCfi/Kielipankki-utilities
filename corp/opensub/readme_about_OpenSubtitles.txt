Short description of the corpus:
The corpus contains Finnish subtitles for movies and TV-series from http://www.opensubtitles.org/ 
The corpus is a derivative of the [OPUS OpenSubtitles2018](http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles2018.php) multilingual corpus. 
Information on the material processing up to sentence splitting can be found in the original publication Lison & Tiedemann (2016). 
The corpus has been tokenized and annotated with morpho-syntactic analysis produced with the [Turku Dependency Parser](http://turkunlp.github.io/Finnish-dep-parser/). P. Lison and J. Tiedemann, 2016, OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)

Additionally, the data was parsed with the Turku Dependency Treebank (TDT) parser, alpha version (FIN-CLARIN VRT tools version 0.8.4). This leads to two sets of annotations in the Korp version.
