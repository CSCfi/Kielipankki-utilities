STT - Conversion of the data

Original data: XML

Conversion process: The script 'combine.sh' combines all files per year. The year has to be changed manually.
The script 'make_simple_xml.sh' runs all necessary scripts and gives out the result in a simple form of xml,
(HRT) with all needed structural attributes in the elements <text>.
The output consists of 27 HRT files, one for each of the years 1992-2018.

The data contains intra-paragraph structures, as a result of preserving the original structure.
This is waiting for being solved.

Note: Data has to be scrambled for Korp. STT will decide, on which level this should happen.

NoteI: It might be worth noting in the META-SHARE record (or in the readme file for the downloadable version) that the 1992â€“2000 items contain no keywords/subjects.
