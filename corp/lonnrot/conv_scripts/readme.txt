Elias Lönnrot Letters Online - Conversion of the data

Original data: XML
Downloaded on 02.10.2019 from http://lonnrot.finlit.fi/omeka/
In IDA: corpora/Lönnrot/Lonnrot_TEI_orig_20191002.zip

Output: The script *make_simple_xml.sh* gives out the result in a simple form of xml (HRT), with all needed structural attributes in the elements <text>.
The output consists of two HRT files, one for the Finnish part and
one for the Swedish part of the corpus.

The data contains intra-paragraph structures, nested elements and sub-word markup (as a result of preserving the original structure).

This is waiting for being solved.
