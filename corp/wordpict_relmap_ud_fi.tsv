# Map the Finnish UD dependency relation labels to those used in the
# Korp word picture: SS (subject), OBJ (object), ADV (adverbial), PA
# (preposition), AT ((pre)modifier), ET (postmodifier), CPL
# (complement). Additional, alternative labels, currently commented
# out and converted to other labels or ignored: APP (apposition), AUX
# (auxiliary verb), CPR (compared element), CRD (coordinated element),
# CPS (copular subject), OTH (other), MOD (modifier), OWN (owner), VPT
# (verb particle). Relations to be ignored are marked with a dash.
#
# In addition, the mapping contains in comments a few tentative
# relation transformations: constructs for specifying derived
# relations that do not occur directly in the data. They are not (yet)
# supported by vrt-extract-relations.py.


# For a name relation, add an extra head containing all the words from
# dependent to head:
# &name	h = d..h
