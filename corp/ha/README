Manual corrections and notes:

kitxtall.txt:

  One non-utf8 character 'é' in word fiancé (on line 8644)
  Empty \t and \m tags (on lines 10364 and 10365)
  Missing name of story (on line 10369)

kiphral2.txt:

  Many sentences have two dates, one after \rf and the other at the end of sentence,
  the script uses the latter.

kiphrall.txt:

  Sometimes one \rf comprises several sentences, e.g. "\rf BF165-175 (BFS01)" (on line 1724).
  These have been manually corrected by adding the missing \rf at start of the sentence.
  That is, "\rf BF165" for the first sentence, "\rf BF166" for the second one, etc.
  Although sometimes there were fewer sentences than listed in the \rf.
