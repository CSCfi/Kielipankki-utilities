Process all source directories with alto-xml2vrt-dirs-new.sh. It is probably
easiest first to split large directories into smaller ones and then generate
commands for batch scripts that should terminate within one hour. For more
information, see batch_scripts/README.

Basically, VRT files are generated from XML files for a given set of directories
with the command:

  alto-xml2vrt-dirs-new.sh "DIR_1 DIR_2 ... DIR_N"

e.g.

  alto-xml2vrt-dirs-new.sh "0025-5149/1937/alto 0025-5149/1938/alto"

which will create

- outputdir/0025-5149/1937/alto/FILE_1.vrt
- outputdir/0025-5149/1937/alto/FILE_2.vrt
- ...
- outputdir/0025-5149/1937/alto/FILE_N.vrt

- outputdir/0025-5149/1938/alto/FILE_1.vrt
- outputdir/0025-5149/1938/alto/FILE_2.vrt
- ...
- outputdir/0025-5149/1938/alto/FILE_N.vrt

Each VRT file will be a concatenation of files that use the same metadata file.

Then analyze the VRT files. Splitting long sentences is advisable. For example
vrt-conll09-mend does this by default after the limit of 1 000 words is reached.

After analyzing, search for possible splitted sentences and rename their
ids with command

  ./check-and-renumber-sentences.sh outputdir

Then generate the corpus package for each year YEAR with command

  ... outputdir/*/YEAR/*/*.vrt
