In the directory that contains the alto XML and metadata files, run command:

  list-dirs.sh [DIR] | combine-dirs.sh THRESHOLD1 | dirs-into-game-commands.sh GAMESCRIPT ALTOSCRIPT THRESHOLD2 THRESHOLD3

where

  -        DIR: the directory where alto files are (finclarin_siirto)
  - THRESHOLD1: how big chunks directories can be combined into, in kilobytes
  - GAMESCRIPT: the batch script
  - ALTOSCRIPT: the XML-to-VRT script (alto-xml2vrt-dirs-new.sh)
  - THRESHOLD2: defines the number of hours reserved for the batch job:
                (SIZE / THRESHOLD2 + 1), where SIZE is the total size of the XML
                files processed by the job, in kilobytes (inferred from output of combine-dirs.sh)
  - THRESHOLD3: the same as THRESHOLD2, but the total number of TextBlock elements
                in XML files is used instead of SIZE
