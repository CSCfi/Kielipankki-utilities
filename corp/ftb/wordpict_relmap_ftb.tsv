# Map the FTB dependency relation labels to those used in the Korp
# word picture: SS (subject), OBJ (object), ADV (adverbial), PA
# (preposition), AT ((pre)modifier), ET (postmodifier), CPL
# (complement). Additional, alternative labels, currently commented
# out and converted to other labels or ignored: AUX (auxiliary verb),
# CPR (compared element), CRD (coordinated element), VPT (verb
# particle). Relations to be ignored are marked with a dash.
#
# In addition, the mapping contains in comments a few tentative
# relation transformations: constructs for specifying derived
# relations that do not occur directly in the data. They are not (yet)
# supported by vrt-extract-relations.py.
