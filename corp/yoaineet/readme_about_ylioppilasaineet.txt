Short description of the corpus:
The corpus consists of Finnish essays written by the students of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 matriculation examinations.


The original data is in RTF format.
For Korp the data was converted to VRT (VeRticalized Text), the input format for the CWB software underlying Korp. The data was tokenized and parsed with the FIN-CLARIN VRT tools version 0.8.4. For parsing we used the Turku Dependency Treebank (TDT) parser, alpha version. The data was NER-tagged with FiNER, a part of Finnish Tagtools version 1.4.0 (http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-201908161).
