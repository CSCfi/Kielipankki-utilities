Converting the texts into vrt
-----------------------------

Get package ceal-en-fi_clean from IDA. Then run:

for author in austen dickens james;
do
  mkdir $author;
  cat ceal-en-fi_clean/${author}_clean.txt | cut -f1 > $author/${author}_en.txt;
  cat ceal-en-fi_clean/${author}_clean.txt | cut -f2 > $author/${author}_fi.txt;
done

You need Turku Dependency Parser Pipeline (TNPP) and language models
for Finnish (fi_tdt) and English (en_ewt). The script expects that
the TNPP script and models are in the current directory. If you have
installed TNPP in a virtual environment, first run:

  source venv-parser-neural/bin/activate

You also need vrt tools from Kielipankki-konversio repository.
Set vrttools variable in file make-ceal.sh so that the script finds them.
Then run:

  ceal-txt-to-vrt.sh [--austen|--dickens|--james] [--fin|--eng]

Source text must be in AUTHOR/AUTHOR_LANG.txt, e.g. austen/austen_fi.txt.

If you are in a virtual environment, run:

  deactivate

after you have generated all vrt files.
